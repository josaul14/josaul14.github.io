Jo’s PhD explored expressive language development in minimally verbal autistic pre-schoolers. She conducted a longitudinal study investigating what predicts individual differences in expressive language development, in particular the role of speech production skills. She also created and piloted an app which delivered a speech sound intervention.\nJo is interested in individual differences in language development and how language impairment impacts mental health, learning and wellbeing. She is passionate about employing open science practices and robust statistical methods to maximise the quality of her research. As mum to a young person with additional needs, she feels strongly that research should reflect the voices of those with lived experience and thus employs participatory research methods and is keen to empower families to play an active role in research. She is also interested in intervention development and evaluation, particularly in how technology may be able to make interventions more accessible to help those with complex neurodevelopmental conditions.\nJo has been a member of the the Wellbeing and Language Lab since 2016. She was also a member of Autistica’s Language and Communication Study Group and is currently on the Meeting on Language in Autism (MoLA) advisory board.\n\nView Jo’s CV here\nView her Google Scholar profile here.\nDr Lauren McGuinness\nDr Lauren McGuinness is a post-doctoral Research Fellow on the project.\nShe completed her ESRC-funded PhD in Psychology in 2025, supervised by Dr Kisten Abbot-Smith at the University of Kent. Lauren’s PhD examined the pragmatic language abilities and communicative preferences of autistic and non-autistic children. During her PhD, Lauren completed a three-month placement at McGill University in Canda, where she worked on a project examining the efficacy of a parent-mediated AAC intervention for minimally verbal children.\nLauren was also previously employed as a Social Researcher at the Office of the Children’s Commissioner, where she worked on projects for the Government’s Child Poverty Unit and the National Youth Strategy. This involved conducting qualitative fieldwork with vulnerable and disadvantaged children who had a range of additional needs.\nLauren is passionate about using mixed-methods research to improve our understanding of autistic children’s diverse communication needs and to promote inclusive, participatory approaches that amplify the voices of under-represented groups.\n\n# Project ISLaND Students\nUndergraduate students\nWe are lucky to be joined by six amazing undergraduate students this year from the BSc in Psychology, BSc in Psychology and Language Sciences and iBSc courses. They are doing a great job of coding communicative acts in our video data and supporting our data collection efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-graduate students\nWe also have several masters students this year from the MSc in Psychological Sciences and Msc Speech and Language Therapy courses. They are taking part in our phonetic data coding and qualitative interview workstreams.\n\n\n\nProject ISLaND Alumni\nLots of former colleagues, students and interns have helped us on our journey…\nMollie Cooke\nMollie is a former research assistant on the project who is now a PhD candidate at the University of Surrey, where she is studying autism in genetic conditions.\nShe completed a MSc in Clinical Neurodevelopmental Sciences at Kings’ College London and prior to that worked for several years in the voluntary sector providing information, support and advocacy to parents, carers and young people with additional needs.\nMollie also has a loved one with complex support needs and she is passionate about including non-speaking and minimially verbal people in research. She is also a current member of the steering group.\n\nPrevious students\nOliver\n\nNatalie\n\n\nJoin us!\nWe hope to grow the lab steadily over the next few years - head to Get involved to find out about potential opportunities to join us or collaborate.\n\n\n\n",

This will help us understand why some neurodivergent people have difficulty acquiring oral communication skills, and how best to support them.\nThis work is supported by a Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellowship awarded to Dr Jo Saul in November 2022: link here.\n\nProject Overview\nAim\nTo investigate why some neurodivergent children have difficulty acquiring spoken language, and how this might impact their social, cognitive, and emotional development.\nMethod\nIn 2023/24, just under 200 families with a minimally verbal child aged 4-12-years were recruited. Participants will be involved in four waves of data collection.\nData will be gathered across a range of domains measuring:\nChildren’s language abilities, including expressive and receptive vocabulary, motor and imitation skills, speech behaviors, preferred methods of communication, and therapeutic interventions.\nOther child-related factors, such as autistic traits, adaptive skills, sleep or feeding difficulties, sensory sensitivities, regression, and puberty.\nWider family-related themes, including caregiver wellbeing, sibling relationships, and formal and informal carer support.\nThis data will be obtained from a combination of caregiver questionnaires and natural language samples of the child communicating with either a family member or researcher.\nOutcome\nGaining a better understanding of this topic will highlight how we can best support minimally verbal children and their families.\n\nElucidating mechanisms of language growth in minimally verbal individuals\nThe primary aim of Project ISLaND is to elucidate mechanisms of language growth in minimally verbal children.\nOur ethos is characterised by an inclusive transdiagnostic approach, mixed methods data collection, open science practices, and co-production with stakeholders.\nIn this longitudinal study, we will track the developmental trajectories of a large cohort of minimally verbal children aged 4-12-years, primarily focussing on their language profiles and communication skills.\nThe findings will address theoretical questions about mechanisms underpinning individual differences in the spoken language abilities of this group, and add to the identification of early value-added predictors of language outcomes for minimally verbal individuals.\nOnce all four waves of data collection are complete, additional information will be sought regarding the educational attainment and medical records of each participant. This will allow us to also evaluate links between observed communication growth and objective health and education milestones.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nIn 2023 we assembled a steering group comprising people with a range of lived experiences with complex communication needs and neuro-developmental conditions.\nWe hold three meetings per year to ensure that the project reflects the views and unique insights of those directly impacted by this research, and that the project is conducted in a way that facilitates inclusion and maximizes participation.\nThe steering group will play an active role in deciding the project’s aims and methods going forward, as well as how results and conclusions are communicated and disseminated.\nIf you are interested in joining the steering group please contact us on pals.island@ucl.ac.uk\nAnna\nI am a Clinical Lead Speech and Language Therapist (Autism Support) at Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust and I have worked with children who are non-speaking for over 20 years. I am particularly interested in sensory processing and healthcare accessibility for children with communication needs.\n\nEmma\nI’m a City Wide SENCO in Sheffield.\nI have worked with a range of children and young people with a variety of needs including Autistic children.\nI am passionate about improving the life chances for children and young people with Special Education Needs.\nKatie\nI am mum to Paddy who has a severe learning disability, autism, and is non verbal.\nI currently work in a SEND school in the north east and am passionate about supporting and advocating for people with communication difficulties.\nI am delighted to be part of the steering group for this research. I am so grateful that this area is being looking into.\nKay\nI’m mum to 2 kids living in Gloucestershire. My son has Autism, GDD and a genetic disorder resulting in learning difficulties and complex communication needs. To communicate he uses a mixture of gestures and PECS but mainly uses Makaton. I became interested in this study as I’d like to understand more about language trajectories for children like him as there is very little information available around this. I joined the steering group in May and have enjoyed listening to other parent / carers & professionals input & suggestions. I am really looking forward to help shape the project and take some great insights away.\nLucinda\nI am the mother of a young person with complex autism and learning disabilities.\nI promote acceptance and awareness of individuals, families, and caregivers affected by severe forms of autism by giving a voice to their realities and needs.\nIn my spare time, I am a writer of fiction and non-fiction and I like to run (slowly) and read a lot – not at the same time.\nLastly, I love this recent Twitter quote from father, director, writer and teacher, Stephen Unwin (@RoseUnwin):\n“In our championing of the many splendid things that so many learning disabled and / or neurodivergent people can do, we must be careful not to marginalise or forget those who can do less.”\n\nNatalie\nI am a Specialist Speech and Language Therapist working for Surrey County Council. I work in mainstream and specialist schools at primary and secondary level. Linking to Project ISLAND’s focus, my areas of interest include autism, speech and unconventional language use.\nNicola\nI’m a Speech and Language Therapist working at Blossom House School which supports children aged 3-19 who have speech, language and communication needs. I have a particular interest in supporting speech across the school, including supporting speech in minimally and pre-verbal children.\n\nRachel\nI’m an assistant Headteacher at a Special school in South Yorkshire.\nRhys\nI am a registered learning disability nurse with both a professional and personal interest in autism, and how trauma impacts/relates to a diagnosis.\nI have a diagnosis of “high functioning” autism or Aspergers and am also father to an autistic son who has verbal and behavioural difficulties.\nToni\nI am mum to three children, all with autism. My youngest and eldest are both pre verbal. We use a total communication approach with both my children. My eldest uses AAC device, voicing, talk tools, now/next boards, visual timetables, colourful semantics, pointing, etc. My youngest uses the same approaches but not the AAC as he is classed as more verbal. I manage my children’s programmes as both are home schooled, although Harris attends the same school as his sister part time. I have a biological sciences background and am an ex high school science teacher. As my background is scientific I am very passionate about research. I am constantly researching new approaches to find ways to help my children so that they can one day advocate for themselves. I am now a support worker one day a week, and also have recently trained as a SEN parent advocate, helping parents get the EHCP their children deserve.\nWendy\nI work supporting my granddaughter who has autism and is non verbal.\nI have 4 grandchildren and all have autism. My son is 34 and recently diagnosed with autism.\nAs a family we are all passionate about new research in speech and language disorders within autistic children. All of my grandchildren and son have experienced some form of speech and language difficulties.\nI have worked with Daisy for nearly 7 years. We use a total communication approach. This includes Talktools as part of our speech and language program. We also use Proloquo to go which is an AAC app with symbols and text to speak, this “gives” Daisy her voice.\nOur whole ethos is to empower Daisy to be able to advocate for herself both now and as an adult.\n\n\n\n",
